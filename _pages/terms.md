By registering, Users agree to be fully responsible for all activities that occur under their username and password.\

The suspension or deletion of User accounts shall not entitle Users to any claims for compensation, damages or reimbursement.

The suspension or deletion of accounts due to causes attributable to the User does not exempt the User from paying any applicable fees or prices.

**Content on Recab**

Unless where otherwise specified or clearly recognizable, all content available on Recab is owned or provided by the Owner or its licensors.

The Owner undertakes its utmost effort to ensure that the content provided on Recab infringes no applicable legal provisions or third-party rights. However, it may not always be possible to achieve such a result.\
In such cases, without prejudice to any legal prerogatives of Users to enforce their rights, Users are kindly asked to preferably report related complaints using the contact details provided in this document.

**Rights regarding content on Recab - All rights reserved**

The Owner holds and reserves all intellectual property rights for any such content.

Users may not therefore use such content in any way that is not necessary or implicit in the proper use of the Service.

In particular, but without limitation, Users may not copy, download, share (beyond the limits set forth below), modify, translate, transform, publish, transmit, sell, sublicense, edit, transfer/assign to third parties or create derivative works from the content available on Recab, nor allow any third party to do so through the User or their device, even without the User's knowledge.

Where explicitly stated on Recab, the User may download, copy and/or share some content available through Recab for its sole personal and non-commercial use and provided that the copyright attributions and all the other attributions requested by the Owner are correctly implemented.

Any applicable statutory limitation or exception to copyright shall stay unaffected.

**Content provided by Users**

The Owner allows Users to upload, share or provide their own content to Recab.

By providing content to Recab, Users confirm that they are legally allowed to do so and that they are not infringing any statutory provisions and/or third-party rights.

Further insights regarding acceptable content can be found inside the section of these Terms which detail the acceptable uses.

**Rights regarding content provided by Users**

Users acknowledge and accept that by providing their own content on Recab they grant the Owner a non-exclusive, fully paid-up and royalty-free license to process such content solely for the operation and maintenance of Recab as contractually required.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, Users waive any moral rights in connection with content they provide to Recab.

Users acknowledge, accept and confirm that all content they provide through Recab is provided subject to the same general conditions set forth for content on Recab.

**Liability for provided content**

Users are solely liable for any content they upload, post, share, or provide through Recab. Users acknowledge and accept that **the Owner does not filter or moderate such content**.

However, the Owner reserves the right to remove, delete, block or rectify such content at its own discretion and to, without prior notice, deny the uploading User access to Recab:

-   if any complaint based on such content is received;
-   if a notice of infringement of intellectual property rights is received;
-   upon order of a public authority; or
-   where the Owner is made aware that the content, while being accessible via Recab, may represent a risk for Users, third parties and/or the availability of the Service.

The removal, deletion, blocking or rectification of content shall not entitle Users that have provided such content or that are liable for it, to any claims for compensation, damages or reimbursement.\
Users agree to hold the Owner harmless from and against any claim asserted and/or damage suffered due to content they provided to or provided through Recab.

**Removal of content from parts of Recab available through the App Store**

No personal data, identifier or any other information related to Users, except for a pseudonym of their choice (such as a nickname or avatar) shall appear in connection with the published content, unless Users decide otherwise on their own initiative.

Users may (and are encouraged to) check on Recab to find details of who can access the content they provide.

**Access to external resources**

Through Recab Users may have access to external resources provided by third parties. Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner has no control over such resources and is therefore not responsible for their content and availability.

Conditions applicable to any resources provided by third parties, including those applicable to any possible grant of rights in content, result from each such third parties' terms and conditions or, in the absence of those, applicable statutory law.

In particular, on Recab Users may see advertisements provided by third parties. The Owner does not control or moderate the advertisements displayed via Recab. If Users click on any such advertisement, they will be interacting with any third party responsible for that advertisement.

The Owner is not responsible for any matters resulting from such interaction with third parties, such as anything resulting from visiting third-party websites or using third-party content.

**Acceptable use**

Recab and the Service may only be used within the scope of what they are provided for, under these Terms and applicable law.

Users are solely responsible for making sure that their use of Recab and/or the Service violates no applicable law, regulations or third-party rights.

Therefore, the Owner reserves the right to take any appropriate measure to protect its legitimate interests including by denying Users access to Recab or the Service, terminating contracts, reporting any misconduct performed through Recab or the Service to the competent authorities -- such as judicial or administrative authorities - whenever Users engage or are suspected to engage in any of the following activities:

-   violate laws, regulations and/or these Terms;
-   infringe any third-party rights;
-   considerably impair the Owner's legitimate interests;
-   offend the Owner or any third party.

**API usage terms**

Users may access their data relating to Recab via the Application Program Interface (API). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product/service that accesses Recab, is bound by these Terms and, in addition, by the following specific terms:

-   the User expressly understands and agrees that the Owner bears no responsibility and shall not be held liable for any damages or losses resulting from the User's use of the API or their use of any third-party products/services that access data through the API.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE**

**Paid Products**

Some of the Products provided on Recab, as part of the Service, are provided on the basis of payment.

The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of Recab.

To purchase Products, the User must register or log into Recab.

**Product description**

Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of Recab and are subject to change without notice.

While Products on Recab are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on Recab through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.

**Purchasing process**

Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

-   Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.
-   After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.

**Order submission**

When the User submits an order, the following applies:

-   The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
-   In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
-   Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.

All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent via sms message to the phone number provided by the User for such purposes.

**Prices**

Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.

Prices on Recab are displayed:

-   either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.

**Methods of payment**

Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of Recab.

All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, Recab does not collect any payment information -- such as credit card details -- but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.

If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.

**Purchase via app store**

Recab or specific Products available for sale on Recab must be purchased via a third-party app store. To access such purchases, Users must follow the instructions provided on the relevant online store (such as "Apple App Store" or "Google Play"), which may vary depending on the particular device in use.

Unless otherwise specified, purchases done via third-party online stores are also subject to such third-parties' terms and conditions, which, in case of any inconsistency or conflict, shall always prevail upon these Terms.

Users purchasing through such third-party online stores must therefore read such terms and conditions of sale carefully and accept them.

**Contract duration**

**Trial period**

Users have the option to test Recab or selected Products during a limited and non-renewable trial period, at no cost. Some features or functions of Recab may not be available to Users during the trial period.\
Further conditions applicable to the trial period, including its duration, will be specified on Recab.

The trial period shall end automatically and shall not convert into any paid Product unless the User actively purchases such paid Product.

**Subscriptions**

Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over a determined period of time.

Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment is received by the Owner.

In order to maintain subscriptions, Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner. Failure to do so may cause service interruptions.

**Subscriptions handled via Apple ID**

Users may subscribe to a Product using the Apple ID associated with their Apple App Store account by using the relevant process on Recab. When doing so, Users acknowledge and accept that

-   any payment due shall be charged to their Apple ID account;
-   subscriptions are automatically renewed for the same duration unless the User cancels at least 24 hours before the current period expires;
-   any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the current period;
-   subscriptions can be managed or cancelled in the Users' Apple App Store account settings.

The above shall prevail upon any conflicting or diverging provision of these Terms.

**Termination**

**Recurring subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or --- if applicable --- by using the corresponding controls inside Recab.**

**Termination of open-ended subscriptions**

**Open-ended subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document.** **Terminations shall take effect 30 days after the notice of termination has been received by the Owner.**

**User rights**

**Right of withdrawal**

Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.

**Who the right of withdrawal applies to**

Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.

Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.

**Exercising the right of withdrawal**

To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.

To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the "definitions" section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.

When does the withdrawal period expire?

-   **Regarding the purchase of a service**, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.

**Effects of withdrawal**

Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.

However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.

Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User's decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.

**...on the purchase of services**

Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.

Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.

**Liability and indemnification**

**EU Users**

**Limitation of liability for User activities on Recab**

Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner merely provides Users with the technical infrastructure and features incorporated in Recab.

The Owner does not intermediate, moderate, promote or intervene in interactions, agreements or transactions between Users and therefore bears no liability for any such interactions among Users, including the performance of any Users' obligations.

**Australian Users**

**Limitation of liability**

Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts or modifies any guarantee, condition, warranty, right or remedy which the User may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) or any similar State and Territory legislation and which cannot be excluded, restricted or modified (non-excludable right). To the fullest extent permitted by law, our liability to the User, including liability for a breach of a non-excludable right and liability which is not otherwise excluded under these Terms of Use, is limited, at the Owner's sole discretion, to the re-performance of the services or the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.

**US Users**

**Disclaimer of Warranties**

**Recab is provided strictly on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Use of the Service is at Users' own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Owner expressly disclaims all conditions, representations, and warranties --- whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of third-party rights. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by user from owner or through the Service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.**

**Without limiting the foregoing, the Owner, its subsidiaries, affiliates, licensors, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that the Service will meet Users' requirements; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the Service is downloaded at users own risk and users shall be solely responsible for any damage to Users' computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or Users' use of the Service.**

**The Owner does not warrant, endorse, guarantee, or assume responsibility for any product or service advertised or offered by a third party through the Service or any hyperlinked website or service, and the Owner shall not be a party to or in any way monitor any transaction between Users and third-party providers of products or services.**

**The Service may become inaccessible or it may not function properly with Users' web browser, mobile device, and/or operating system. The owner cannot be held liable for any perceived or actual damages arising from Service content, operation, or use of this Service.**

**Federal law, some states, and other jurisdictions, do not allow the exclusion and limitations of certain implied warranties. The above exclusions may not apply to Users. This Agreement gives Users specific legal rights, and Users may also have other rights which vary from state to state. The disclaimers and exclusions under this agreement shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.**

**Limitations of liability**

**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for**

-   **any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Service; and**
-   **any damage, loss or injury resulting from hacking, tampering or other unauthorized access or use of the Service or User account or the information contained therein;**
-   **any errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content;**
-   **personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from User access to or use of the Service;**
-   **any unauthorized access to or use of the Owner's secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein;**
-   **any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from the Service;**
-   **any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through the Service;**
-   **any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Service; and/or**
-   **the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any User or third party. In no event shall the Owner, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees be liable for any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the amount paid by User to the Owner hereunder in the preceding 12 months, or the period of duration of this agreement between the Owner and User, whichever is shorter.**

**This limitation of liability section shall apply to the fullest extent permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if company has been advised of the possibility of such damage.**

**Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, therefore the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to User. The terms give User specific legal rights, and User may also have other rights which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under the terms shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.**

**Indemnification**

**The User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Owner and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees harmless from and against any and all claims or demands, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, arising from**

-   **User's use of and access to the Service, including any data or content transmitted or received by User;**
-   **User's violation of these terms, including, but not limited to, User's breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in these terms;**
-   **User's violation of any third-party rights, including, but not limited to, any right of privacy or intellectual property rights;**
-   **User's violation of any statutory law, rule, or regulation;**
-   **any content that is submitted from User's account, including third party access with User's unique username, password or other security measure, if applicable, including, but not limited to, misleading, false, or inaccurate information;**
-   **User's wilful misconduct; or**
-   **statutory provision by User or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders, partners, suppliers and employees to the extent allowed by applicable law.**

**Common provisions**

**No Waiver**

The Owner's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any such right or provision. No waiver shall be considered a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

**Service interruption**

To ensure the best possible service level, the Owner reserves the right to interrupt the Service for maintenance, system updates or any other changes, informing the Users appropriately.

Within the limits of law, the Owner may also decide to suspend or terminate the Service altogether. If the Service is terminated, the Owner will cooperate with Users to enable them to withdraw Personal Data or information in accordance with applicable law.

Additionally, the Service might not be available due to reasons outside the Owner's reasonable control, such as "force majeure" (eg. labor actions, infrastructural breakdowns or blackouts etc).

**Service reselling**

Users may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of Recab and of its Service without the Owner's express prior written permission, granted either directly or through a legitimate reselling programme.

**Privacy policy**

To learn more about the use of their Personal Data, Users may refer to the privacy policy of Recab.

**Intellectual property rights**

Without prejudice to any more specific provision of these Terms, any intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights and design rights related to Recab are the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties relating to intellectual property.

All trademarks --- nominal or figurative --- and all other marks, trade names, service marks, word marks, illustrations, images, or logos appearing in connection with Recab are, and remain, the exclusive property of the Owner or its licensors and are subject to the protection granted by applicable laws or international treaties related to intellectual property.

**Changes to these Terms**

The Owner reserves the right to amend or otherwise modify these Terms at any time. In such cases, the Owner will appropriately inform the User of these changes.

Such changes will only affect the relationship with the User for the future.

The continued use of the Service will signify the User's acceptance of the revised Terms. If Users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must stop using the Service. Failure to accept the revised Terms, may entitle either party to terminate the Agreement.

The applicable previous version will govern the relationship prior to the User's acceptance. The User can obtain any previous version from the Owner.

If required by applicable law, the Owner will specify the date by which the modified Terms will enter into force.

**Assignment of contract**

The Owner reserves the right to transfer, assign, dispose of by novation, or subcontract any or all rights or obligations under these Terms, taking the User's legitimate interests into account. Provisions regarding changes of these Terms will apply accordingly.

Users may not assign or transfer their rights or obligations under these Terms in any way, without the written permission of the Owner.

**Contacts**

All communications relating to the use of Recab must be sent using the contact information stated in this document.

**Severability**

Should any provision of these Terms be deemed or become invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect.

**US Users**

Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent reasonably required to render it valid, enforceable and consistent with its original intent. These Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Users and the Owner with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all other communications, including but not limited to all prior agreements, between the parties with respect to such subject matter. These Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

**EU Users**

Should any provision of these Terms be or be deemed void, invalid or unenforceable, the parties shall do their best to find, in an amicable way, an agreement on valid and enforceable provisions thereby substituting the void, invalid or unenforceable parts.\
In case of failure to do so, the void, invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be replaced by the applicable statutory provisions, if so permitted or stated under the applicable law.

Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.

**Governing law**

These Terms are governed by the law of the place where the Owner is based, as disclosed in the relevant section of this document, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

**Exception for European Consumers**

However, regardless of the above, if the User qualifies as a European Consumer and has their habitual residence in a country where the law provides for a higher consumer protection standard, such higher standards shall prevail.

**Venue of jurisdiction**

The exclusive competence to decide on any controversy resulting from or connected to these Terms lies with the courts of the place where the Owner is based, as displayed in the relevant section of this document.

**Exception for European Consumers**

The above does not apply to any Users that qualify as European Consumers, nor to Consumers based in Switzerland, Norway or Iceland.

**Dispute resolution**

**Amicable dispute resolution**

Users may bring any disputes to the Owner who will try to resolve them amicably.

The User may submit the complaint including a brief description and if applicable, the details of the related order, purchase, or account, to the Owner's email address specified in this document.
