Further information about the processing of Personal Data

- Analysis and predictions based on the User's Data ("profiling")

 The Owner may use the Personal and Usage Data collected through Recab to create or update User profiles. This type of Data processing allows the Owner to evaluate User choices, preferences and behaviour for the purposes outlined in the respective section of this document.

User profiles can also be created through the use of automated tools like algorithms, which can also be provided by third parties. To find out more about the profiling activities performed, Users can check the relevant sections of this document.

The User always has a right to object to this kind of profiling activity. To find out more about the User's rights and how to exercise them, the User is invited to consult the section of this document outlining the rights of the User.

- Automated decision-making

 Automated decision-making means that a decision which is likely to have legal effects or similarly significant effects on the User, is taken solely by technological means, without any human intervention.

Recab may use the User's Personal Data to make decisions entirely or partially based on automated processes according to the purposes outlined in this document.

Recab adopts automated decision-making processes as far as necessary to enter into or perform a contract between User and Owner, or on the basis of the User's explicit consent, where such consent is required by the law.

Automated decisions are made by technological means -- mostly based on algorithms subject to predefined criteria -- which may also be provided by third parties.

The rationale behind the automated decision making is:

- to enable or otherwise improve the decision-making process;

- to grant Users fair and unbiased treatment based on consistent and uniform criteria;

- to reduce the potential harm derived from human error, personal bias and the like which may potentially lead to discrimination or imbalance in the treatment of individuals etc.;

- to reduce the risk of User's failure to meet their obligation under a contract.

To find out more about the purposes, the third-party services, if any, and any specific rationale for automated decisions used within Recab, Users can check the relevant sections in this document.

Consequences of automated decision-making processes for Users and rights of Users subjected to it

As a consequence, Users subject to such processing, are entitled to exercise specific rights aimed at preventing or otherwise limiting the potential effects of the automated decisions taken.

In particular, Users have the right to:

- obtain an explanation about any decision taken as a result of automated decision-making and express their point of view regarding this decision;

- challenge a decision by asking the Owner to reconsider it or take a new decision on a different basis;

- request and obtain from the Owner human intervention on such processing.

To learn more about the User's rights and the means to exercise them, the User is invited to consult the section of this document relating to the rights of the User.

 Further information about the processing of Personal Data

- Analysis and predictions based on the User's Data ("profiling")

 The Owner may use the Personal and Usage Data collected through Recab to create or update User profiles. This type of Data processing allows the Owner to evaluate User choices, preferences and behaviour for the purposes outlined in the respective section of this document.

User profiles can also be created through the use of automated tools like algorithms, which can also be provided by third parties. To find out more about the profiling activities performed, Users can check the relevant sections of this document.

The User always has a right to object to this kind of profiling activity. To find out more about the User's rights and how to exercise them, the User is invited to consult the section of this document outlining the rights of the User.

- Automated decision-making

 Automated decision-making means that a decision which is likely to have legal effects or similarly significant effects on the User, is taken solely by technological means, without any human intervention.

Recab may use the User's Personal Data to make decisions entirely or partially based on automated processes according to the purposes outlined in this document.

Recab adopts automated decision-making processes as far as necessary to enter into or perform a contract between User and Owner, or on the basis of the User's explicit consent, where such consent is required by the law.

Automated decisions are made by technological means -- mostly based on algorithms subject to predefined criteria -- which may also be provided by third parties.

The rationale behind the automated decision making is:

- to enable or otherwise improve the decision-making process;

- to grant Users fair and unbiased treatment based on consistent and uniform criteria;

- to reduce the potential harm derived from human error, personal bias and the like which may potentially lead to discrimination or imbalance in the treatment of individuals etc.;

- to reduce the risk of User's failure to meet their obligation under a contract.

To find out more about the purposes, the third-party services, if any, and any specific rationale for automated decisions used within Recab, Users can check the relevant sections in this document.

Consequences of automated decision-making processes for Users and rights of Users subjected to it

As a consequence, Users subject to such processing, are entitled to exercise specific rights aimed at preventing or otherwise limiting the potential effects of the automated decisions taken.

In particular, Users have the right to:

- obtain an explanation about any decision taken as a result of automated decision-making and express their point of view regarding this decision;

- challenge a decision by asking the Owner to reconsider it or take a new decision on a different basis;

- request and obtain from the Owner human intervention on such processing.

To learn more about the User's rights and the means to exercise them, the User is invited to consult the section of this document relating to the rights of the User.

- Equal protection of User Data

 Recab shares User Data only with third parties carefully selected to ensure that they provide the same or equal protection of User Data as stated in this privacy policy and requested by applicable data protection laws. Further information on data processing and privacy practices by third parties can be found in their respective privacy policies.

 localStorage allows Recab to store and access data right in the User's browser with no expiration date.

Users must be aware that disabling push notifications may negatively affect the utility of Recab.

- Push notifications based on the User's geographic location

 Recab may use the User's geographic location to send push notifications for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy.

Users may in most cases opt-out of receiving push notifications by visiting their device settings, such as the notification settings for mobile phones, and then changing those settings for some or all of the apps on the particular device.

Users must be aware that disabling push notifications may negatively affect the utility of Recab.

- Push notifications for direct marketing

 Recab may send push notifications to the User for the purpose of direct marketing (to propose services and products provided by third parties or unrelated to the product or service provided by Recab).

Users may in most cases opt-out of receiving push notifications by visiting their device settings, such as the notification settings for mobile phones, and then changing those settings for Recab or all of the apps on the particular device.

Users must be aware that disabling push notifications may negatively affect the utility of Recab.
