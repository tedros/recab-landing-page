## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How do I personalize my news feed?

To personalize your news feed, go to the 'Settings' tab and specify your interests and target language(s). Recab will generate articles accordingly.

### What is Sentence Regeneration?

The "Regen" button helps you understand difficult sentences by rephrasing them with simpler words while retaining the original meaning.

### How do I add words to my wordlists?

While reading an article tap on any unfamiliar word and it will automatically be added to your target wordlists for that language.

### How can I interact with the article-based chatbot?

Once you complete reading an article, you'll be directed to the 'Practice' page, where you can chat with a bot that's been trained on the article's content.

### What is Mixed Language Input?

You can converse with the chatbot in both your native and target languages. This is especially helpful for users still getting comfortable with forming complete sentences in their new language.
